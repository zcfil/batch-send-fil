# go-secp256k1 - Go wrapper for the C secp256k1 library

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipsn/go-secp256k1?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipsn/go-secp256k1)

This repository is a standalone clone of the `secp256k1` Go wrapper from the [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) code base as used by Ethereum. The reason for forking it is to permit alternative use cases without having to depend on the upstream 1GB repository.

Any issues or PRs with regard to this library should be submitted upstream to the `go-ethereum` project. All changes will be downstreamed into this fork once merged there.
